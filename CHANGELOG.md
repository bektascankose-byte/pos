# Changelog

Notable changes. Newest first.

## Phase 1 — API vertical slice

Auth, tenancy, RBAC, idempotency, catalog, inventory and sync, working end to end
against real Postgres. 34 end to end checks pass.

### Added

- **`apps/api`** — NestJS on Fastify. Platform layer (database, auth, RBAC,
  idempotency, errors, validation) plus catalog, inventory, sync and org modules.
- **`packages/contracts`** — Zod schemas as the single source of truth, with the
  `Money` type. 24 tests.
- **Migration 0006** — `product.view`, `sync.upload`, `sync.download`.
- **Migration 0007** — `auth_lookup_user` and `auth_lookup_session`.
- **`InventoryRepository`** — the only code permitted to write `inventory_levels`,
  always in the same transaction as a ledger entry. `reconcile()` proves the
  projection still equals `sum(delta)`.
- **End to end suite** — resets the database, starts the API, exercises the real
  HTTP surface.

### Fixed

- **Login could not work under RLS.** The policy denies when `app.org_id` is
  unset, and the organization is unknown until the user is found. Resolved with
  two narrow `SECURITY DEFINER` lookups (migration 0007) rather than by weakening
  the policy or connecting as a role that bypasses RLS. Fixed column lists,
  `search_path` pinned, `EXECUTE` revoked from `PUBLIC`.
- **Every validation failure returned 500.** The API compiles to CommonJS and
  `@snappos/contracts` is ESM, so each half loads a different copy of zod and
  `instanceof ZodError` is false across that boundary, despite npm installing
  exactly one version. The validation pipe now converts at the boundary and the
  filter duck types as a fallback.
- **Deterministic ledger ids did not actually prevent double counting.**
  `inventory_ledger` is partitioned by month, so its key is `(id, occurred_at)`
  and not `id` alone. A replay reusing the id while letting `occurred_at` default
  to `now()` inserted a second row while appearing protected. The repository now
  refuses a deterministic id without a deterministic timestamp, and the sync path
  derives the timestamp from the UUIDv7's own embedded clock so the two cannot
  disagree.
- **The seed was not re-runnable.** It deleted the organization, which
  `ON DELETE RESTRICT` correctly forbids once stores exist. It now clears its own
  tables in dependency order. The earlier "idempotent" check had passed against a
  state that did not exercise the constraint.

### Security

- The API refuses to start if it detects a database role that owns tables, is a
  superuser, or has `BYPASSRLS`.
- Refresh token rotation with family revocation on reuse.
- Argon2id for passwords; cheaper parameters plus lockout for register PINs.
- Constant time response for unknown accounts at login.
- Upgraded NestJS to 12 and drizzle-orm to 0.45.2, clearing a high severity SQL
  injection advisory (GHSA-gpj5-g38j-94v9) and two fastify advisories.

### Documentation

`SECURITY.md`, `DATABASE.md`, `API.md`, `MONEY.md`, `COMPLIANCE.md`,
`INTEGRATIONS.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`, `TESTING.md`.

## Phase 0 — Repository foundation

The architecture and migrations existed; the repository did not. Nine files sat
flat in the project root while the README and the invariant test referenced a
layout that had never been created.

### Added

- npm workspaces monorepo (npm rather than pnpm and Turborepo: it ships with
  Node and needs no install step on a new machine).
- Migration runner with checksum tracking, so editing an applied migration is a
  hard error rather than a silent divergence.
- `bootstrap-roles.sql` — the `snappos_migrator` / `snappos_app` split. **Nothing
  previously created these roles**, which meant RLS had never been exercised
  against a non-owner.
- RLS test suite, 9 tests, connecting as the unprivileged role.
- Dual engine testing: every suite runs on PGlite and on real PostgreSQL 16.
- Seed with a realistic catalog — six products, twelve variants, one deliberately
  out of stock. Opening stock posts through the ledger.
- CI: PGlite as the fast gate, PostgreSQL as the authoritative one.

### Fixed

- The README's "26 passing tests" **could not be reproduced by anyone**: no
  `package.json`, no PGlite dependency, no `migrate.test.mjs`. All 26 now pass on
  both engines.
- The claimed "78 check constraints" was partition inclusive and therefore date
  dependent — `ensure_monthly_partitions()` creates partitions relative to
  `now()`, and it had already drifted to 76. Tests now assert only counts that
  are stable facts about the migrations.
- PostgreSQL test files run serially. Each bootstraps roles and grants, which
  write cluster wide catalogs, and running them in parallel produced
  `tuple concurrently updated` at random points.

## Prior work

Architecture (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, sections A–O) and the Phase 1 schema:
63 tables, 93 foreign keys, 20 enums, RLS policies, append only triggers,
monthly partitioning, UUIDv7 generation.
